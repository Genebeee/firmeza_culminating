        <h3>Good Day!</h3>
        <p>My name is Genevieve Mae L. Firmeza but you can call me "Gen" for short. I'm 17 years old and I like to 
            draw digitally, play video games and calligraphy. I chose ICT as my strand because  I want to learn 
            more about animation, web development, editing using adobe applications and coding. It is also alligned with 
            the course that I will be taking in college which is BSIT. I'm also looking forward to taking the TESDA NCII to 
            test my skills and increase the chances of being hired in the future. My achievements academically last year
            is being in the Honor roll. My personal achievements are learning to play an instrument specifically the Piano,
            winning 3rd place for the O-poster making and claimed champion for String Arts last year.</p>
